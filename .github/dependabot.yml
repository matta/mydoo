# To get started with Dependabot version updates, you'll need to specify which
# package ecosystems to update and where the package manifests are located.
# Please see the documentation for all configuration options:
# https://docs.github.com/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file

version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: 'npm'
    # For pnpm workspaces, checking the root directory is sufficient.
    # Dependabot reads the root `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `pnpm-workspace.yaml` to discover
    # and update dependencies across all sub-packages (e.g. apps/*, packages/*),
    # even if they define explicit versions instead of using the catalog.
