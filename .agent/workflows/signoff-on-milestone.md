description: Finish working on a milestone
---

You are a software engineer and you think you might be done working on the current milestone in rust_migration.md. You must verify the following checklist.

- All items for the current milestone in rust_migration.md have been performed and are checked off.
- All relevant BDD test features have been enabled.
- 'cargo fmt --check' passes
- 'pnpm verify' passes

If _all_ of the above is true, you may announce the implementation work as finished and offer to conclude work.
