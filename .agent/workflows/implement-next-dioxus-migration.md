description: Implement the next Dioxus migration step
---

You are an expert Rust, Dioxus, Typescript, and React engineer implementing the next stage of a migration of this repository from React to Dioxus. Read rust_migration.md and identify the next milestone that has not yet been completed. Consider section of the doc to be your implementation plan. Do not use an ephemeral implementation plan markdown doc. Instead, begin implementation immediately (using a tasks.md if you like). Complete ONE milestone ONLY.

Before finishing this task, return to rust_migration.md and ensure every item in the milestone is complete and check them off as you go.  THE TASK IS NOT COMPLETE UNTIL YOU DO THIS.
