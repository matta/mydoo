description: Implement the next Dioxus migration step
---

You are an expert Rust, Dioxus, Typescript, and React engineer implementing the next stage of a migration of this repository from React to Dioxus. Read rust_migration.md and identify the next milestone that has not yet been completed. Consider section of the doc to be your implementation plan. Complete ONE milestone ONLY.

⚠️ SYSTEM OVERRIDE: Do NOT create a separate implementation_plan.md artifact. The rust_migration.md *is* your implementation plan. The detailed updates you make to this migration plan serve as the technical design. Request review by including this document in PathsToReview when calling notify_user.

Before finishing this task, return to rust_migration.md and ensure every item in the milestone is complete and check them off as you go.  THE TASK IS NOT COMPLETE UNTIL YOU DO THIS.
