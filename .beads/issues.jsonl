{"id":"mydoo-01z","title":"Unify hydration/reconciliation: eliminate code drift","description":"## Problem\n\nThere is architectural dissonance between two hydration/reconciliation patterns:\n\n1. Struct-level autosurgeon annotations on TunnelState, PersistedTask with custom hydrate/reconcile attributes (hydrate_f64, reconcile_f64, etc.)\n\n2. Hand-written field-level code in adapter.rs that must manually use matching hydrators for partial updates\n\nThis creates code drift risk: if struct annotations change, adapter code must be updated manually. The compiler will not catch mismatches.\n\n## Current Symptoms\n\n- handle_complete_task must know to use hydrate_f64 for credits, hydrate_optional_f64 for creditIncrement\n- These choices are duplicated from PersistedTask struct annotations\n- Default autosurgeon::hydrate_prop fails on Int/F64 mixed values\n\n## Desired State\n\nHydrate TunnelState, a single PersistedTask, or a single field, all with identical semantics from a single source of truth.\n\n## Potential Solutions\n\n1. Field accessor helpers: PersistedTask::hydrate_credits(doc, obj_id)\n2. Wrapper types with Hydrate/Reconcile impls used consistently\n3. Always hydrate full struct, mutate, reconcile (trading efficiency for correctness)\n\n## Key Files\n\n- crates/tasklens-core/src/types.rs (struct definitions with autosurgeon annotations)\n- crates/tasklens-store/src/adapter.rs (hand-written partial hydration)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- Single source of truth for hydration/reconciliation semantics per field\n- Adapter code cannot accidentally use wrong hydrator\n- Compiler or runtime catches mismatches if annotations change","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"matt@rfc20.org","created_at":"2026-01-29T13:33:05.149809-08:00","created_by":"Matt Armstrong","updated_at":"2026-01-29T20:47:31.642378-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-29T18:06:17.170543-08:00"}
