{"id":"mydoo-01z","title":"Unify hydration/reconciliation: eliminate code drift","description":"## Problem\n\nThere is architectural dissonance between two hydration/reconciliation patterns:\n\n1. Struct-level autosurgeon annotations on TunnelState, PersistedTask with custom hydrate/reconcile attributes (hydrate_f64, reconcile_f64, etc.)\n\n2. Hand-written field-level code in adapter.rs that must manually use matching hydrators for partial updates\n\nThis creates code drift risk: if struct annotations change, adapter code must be updated manually. The compiler will not catch mismatches.\n\n## Current Symptoms\n\n- handle_complete_task must know to use hydrate_f64 for credits, hydrate_optional_f64 for creditIncrement\n- These choices are duplicated from PersistedTask struct annotations\n- Default autosurgeon::hydrate_prop fails on Int/F64 mixed values\n\n## Desired State\n\nHydrate TunnelState, a single PersistedTask, or a single field, all with identical semantics from a single source of truth.\n\n## Potential Solutions\n\n1. Field accessor helpers: PersistedTask::hydrate_credits(doc, obj_id)\n2. Wrapper types with Hydrate/Reconcile impls used consistently\n3. Always hydrate full struct, mutate, reconcile (trading efficiency for correctness)\n\n## Key Files\n\n- crates/tasklens-core/src/types.rs (struct definitions with autosurgeon annotations)\n- crates/tasklens-store/src/adapter.rs (hand-written partial hydration)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- Single source of truth for hydration/reconciliation semantics per field\n- Adapter code cannot accidentally use wrong hydrator\n- Compiler or runtime catches mismatches if annotations change","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"matt@rfc20.org","created_at":"2026-01-29T13:33:05.149809-08:00","created_by":"Matt Armstrong","updated_at":"2026-01-29T18:06:17.170543-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-29T18:06:17.170543-08:00","close_reason":"Closed"}

{"id":"mydoo-cjj","title":"Improve cycle healing to preserve parent hierarchy instead of promoting to root","description":"## Background\n\nWhen concurrent moves create cycles (e.g., Replica A moves task-1 under task-2 while Replica B moves task-2 under task-1), the merged document contains a closed loop unreachable from the root hierarchy. The current fix in heal_structural_inconsistencies detects these unreachable tasks and breaks the cycle by promoting them to root tasks.\n\n## Why This Is Suboptimal\n\nPromoting cyclic tasks to root loses useful structural information. Consider tasks A and B that were both children of task P before the concurrent moves. After healing, one ends up at root level rather than remaining under P. This can be surprising to users who see tasks jump to the top level unexpectedly.\n\nThe ideal behavior would preserve the original parent relationship for at least one of the conflicting tasks, so the tree structure remains as close as possible to what either replica intended.\n\n## Possible Approaches\n\n1. Operation-level detection: Intercept move operations during merge and detect cycles before they are committed. This would require hooking into Automerge change application.\n\n2. Schema change: Store move history or preferred parent metadata that survives merges, allowing smarter conflict resolution.\n\n3. Last-write-wins on parent_id: Use Automerge conflict resolution metadata to determine which parent_id won and use that to inform cycle breaking.\n\n4. Preserve one parent link: When breaking a cycle, instead of clearing parent_id entirely, traverse the cycle to find the oldest or most stable parent relationship and preserve it.\n\n## Current Implementation\n\nThe expedient fix walks from roots to find reachable tasks, then promotes any unreachable tasks to root by clearing their parent_id. This guarantees invariants are restored but at the cost of hierarchy fidelity.","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","owner":"matt@rfc20.org","created_at":"2026-02-02T10:06:30.025445-08:00","created_by":"Matt Armstrong","updated_at":"2026-02-03T10:24:42.282324-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"mydoo-cjj","depends_on_id":"mydoo-1wb","type":"relates-to","created_at":"2026-02-03T10:16:34.361413-08:00","created_by":"Matt Armstrong"},{"issue_id":"mydoo-cjj","depends_on_id":"mydoo-cqu","type":"relates-to","created_at":"2026-02-03T10:25:12.398503-08:00","created_by":"Matt Armstrong"}]}
